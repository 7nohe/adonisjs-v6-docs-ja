# Mocks and fakes

When testing your applications, you might want to mock or fake certain classes in order to prevent actual implementations to run. For example, you do not want to send emails to your customers when running tests and neither call third party services like a payment gateway.

In this guide, we will cover the following topics.

- Use [sinon]() for mocking service classes and injecting them to the controllers.
- Use [nock]() for intercepting network requests and mocking responses.
- Use the fakes API of AdonisJS container services.
